## What are the differences between LinearLayout RelativeLayout and AbsoluteLayout?
* LinearLayout means you can align views one by one (vertically/ horizontally).

* RelativeLayout means based on relation of views from its parents and other views.

* ConstraintLayout is similar to a RelativeLayout in that it uses relations to position and size widgets, but has additional flexibility and is easier to use in the Layout Editor.

* WebView to load html, static or dynamic pages.

* FrameLayout to load child one above another, like cards inside a frame, we can place one above another or anywhere inside the frame.

* deprecated -  AbsoluteLayout means you have to give exact position where the view should be.
